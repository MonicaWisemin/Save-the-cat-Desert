# Save-the-cat-Desert
Hi! This is Monica and I'm thrilled to show you the demo pygame project I worked on called **Save the cat! Desert** . You can see I deployed an agent to play my game;) 
Hope I won't just let it stays like this forever haha  
Pygame tutorial from  @CodingWithRuss  ! Real cool tutorials and helped me a lot! 


Before starting this game, please open gameWindow.py, ghost.py and cat.py to change the absolute path of where the pictures store, 
or it would report errors.
This is just a demo, so it don't really have much fuctions, but I made it on my own!
Have fun uwu<3
