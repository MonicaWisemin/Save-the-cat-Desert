Hi! This is Monica and I'm thrilled to show you the demo pygame project I worked on called **Save the cat! Desert** . You can see I deployed an agent to play my game;) Hope I won't just let it stays like this forever haha  Pygame tutorial from  @CodingWithRuss  ! Real cool tutorials and helped me a lot!
